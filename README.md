This is a simple terminal-based Expense Tracker built using Python and MySQL. It allows users to log daily expenses with details such as amount, category, and date, and then analyze spending patterns through various reports. The system supports viewing daily totals, category-wise summaries, and monthly breakdowns. All data is stored in a MySQL database, and the application uses SQL queries to generate insights without relying on external libraries.
